This is a test post to demonstrate the new citation functionality in blockquotes.

## Citation via Text Pattern

You can also include the citation directly in the blockquote text using an em dash:

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
> — Steve Jobs

## Citation on Same Line

Citations can also be on the same line:

## Regular Blockquote

And of course, blockquotes without citations work exactly as before:

> This is just a regular blockquote without any citation information.

## Multiple Paragraphs with Citation

> This is a longer quote that spans multiple paragraphs.
>
> It demonstrates how the citation parsing works when there are multiple lines and paragraphs in the blockquote.
> — Marcus Aurelius
