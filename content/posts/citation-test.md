This is a test post to demonstrate the new citation functionality in blockquotes.

## Citation via Text Pattern

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
> — Steve Jobs

## Citation with link

> Well, the types of computers we have today are tools. They’re responders: you ask a computer to do something and it will do it. The next stage is going to be computers as “agents.” In other words, it will be as if there’s a little person inside that box who starts to anticipate what you want. Rather than help you, it will start to guide you through large amounts of information. It will almost be like you have a little friend inside that box. I think the computer as an agent will start to mature in the late '80s, early '90s.

## Regular Blockquote

> This is just a regular blockquote without any citation information.

## Multiple Paragraphs with Citation

> This is a longer quote that spans multiple paragraphs.
>
> It demonstrates how the citation parsing works when there are multiple lines and paragraphs in the blockquote.
> — Marcus Aurelius
