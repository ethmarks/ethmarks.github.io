[PaintTransformer](https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer) is a neural network that approximates images using paint strokes. This gives it a very pretty and stylized watercolor/painterly aesthetic.

I like how this looks, and I'll sometimes just run random photos through it to see how they turn out.

Another cool thing you can do is save each step as a frame, which creates a cool animation similar to a [watercolor timelapse](https://youtu.be/1rc0qmqcqMY).

PaintTransformer starts by adding with broad, vague brush strokes and ends with tiny details. It's just a few blobs of colour at the start and it's highly detailed at the end. This makes for a fun charades-like game: how quickly can you guess what it's painting?

PaintTransformer was developed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03798) by a team of researchers. It was later [implemented in PyTorch](https://github.com/Huage001/PaintTransformer) by [Huage001](https://github.com/Huage001)

I wanted to use PaintTransformer, but my makeshift solution of uploading files to a Colab runtime was too clunky to be used at scale. So I instead decided to build a custom interface. I named it ColourlessTransformer because I was going through a phase of naming everything eponymously after my old username, ColourlessSpearmint.

## Streamlit

This was my first time working with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). I originally planned to use [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for this project because I had previous experience, but Gradio is an extremely heavy framework for my use case, and the 2-minute starting times were bothering me. I'm quite happy with how the it turned out.

On the right is the corresponding generated animation, which depicts the same scene rendered in a painterly, watercolor-like style with broad brushstrokes and vibrant colors.](~/painttransformer_interface_toby_chickens.webp "Using ColourlessTransformer to apply PaintTransformer to a photo of my cat, Toby")

## Usage

If you want to try this out on your own, follow the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/ethmarks/ColourlessTransformer?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). You'll need Git, Python, a GPU, and some familiarity with the terminal.

## Conclusion

![Two images of the Seattle Space Needle, side-by-side. The left image is an photo, and the one on the right is is heavily stylized and painterly image generated by PaintTransformer](~/painttransformer_space_needle_comparison.webp "PaintTransformer applied to a photo I took of the Seattle Space Needle")

ColourlessTransformer was one of my favorite projects because I started with a complex task that took 3-5 minutes of tedious parameter filling and file reorganization and ended with a sleek, fast, and painless custom application.

Apparently it wasn't enough to automate watercolor; I also had to automate the automation.
