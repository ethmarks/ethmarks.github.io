{{< poem >}}
The dawn's first light, a furnace glow,
Steel muscles flex, the pistons go.
A rhythmic clang, a hammer's blow,
The symphony of industry starts to flow.

Clang, clank, bang, the gears engage,
A chorus of belts on a metal stage.
Whines and hisses, a steamy rage,
As pistons pump in their measured cage.

Whistles shriek, a piercing call,
Conductors hidden, unseen by all.
Sparks ignite, a fiery wall,
The molten heart of the industrial sprawl.

Welding's arc, a searing light,
A counterpoint in the fading night.
Grinders growl with all their might,
Shaping form from the material's plight.

Machines hum, a lullaby,
A soothing drone that reaches high.
The sparks and gears blot out the sky,
Maintaining the rhythm, the constant tie.

From dawn's first light to the setting sun,
The symphony plays, ever begun.
A testament to what we've done,
The power and progress, fiercely won.
