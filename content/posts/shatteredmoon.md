{{< poem >}}
The shattered orb, a crown askew,
Hangs heavy in the velvet blue.
A fractured moon, a broken dream,
Casts slivered light on shadowed scene.

Below, the land, in shades of grey,
Awaits the dawn, another day.
The jagged peaks, a stark ballet,
Reach for the sky in disarray.

A twisted forest, gnarled and old,
Whispers secrets, never told.
The winding river, silvered thread,
Reflects the moon, fractured and dead.

A lone wolf howls, a mournful cry,
As shadows dance 'neath moonless sky.
