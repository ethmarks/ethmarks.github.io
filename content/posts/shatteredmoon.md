{{< blockquote >}}
The shattered orb, a crown askew,  
Hangs heavy in the velvet blue.  
A fractured moon, a broken dream,  
Casts slivered light on shadowed scene.  

Below, the land, in shades of grey,  
Awaits the dawn, another day.  
The jagged peaks, a stark ballet,  
Reach for the sky in disarray.  

A twisted forest, gnarled and old,  
Whispers secrets, never told.  
The winding river, silvered thread,  
Reflects the moon, fractured and dead.  

A lone wolf howls, a mournful cry,  
As shadows dance 'neath moonless sky.
