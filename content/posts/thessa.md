[Thessa](https://thessa.vercel.app/) is an AI-powered thesaurus website I built.

## Why?

I built Thessa because I noticed that LLMs are pretty good at using interesting and esoteric words. Opening up an LLM interface and copy-pasting my synonym prompt was inconvenient, so I wanted to build a website to streamline the process. In May 2025, I built [Thessa v1](/posts/thessa-v1). Later, in December 2025, I remade Thessa from the ground up as Thessa v2, which is the current version of Thessa and the one that this article is about.
