>> The dawn's first light, a furnace glow,  
>> Steel muscles flex, the pistons go.  
>> A rhythmic clang, a hammer's blow,  
>> The symphony of industry starts to flow.  
>> 
>> Clang, clank, bang, the gears engage,  
>> A chorus of belts on a metal stage.  
>> Whines and hisses, a steamy rage,  
>> As pistons pump in their measured cage.  
>> 
>> Whistles shriek, a piercing call,  
>> Conductors hidden, unseen by all.  
>> Sparks ignite, a fiery wall,  
>> The molten heart of the industrial sprawl.  
>> 
>> Welding's arc, a searing light,  
>> A counterpoint in the fading night.  
>> Grinders growl with all their might,  
>> Shaping form from the material's plight.  
>> 
>> Machines hum, a lullaby,  
>> A soothing drone that reaches high.  
>> The sparks and gears blot out the sky,  
>> Maintaining the rhythm, the constant tie.  
>> 
>> From dawn's first light to the setting sun,  
>> The symphony plays, ever begun.  
>> A testament to what we've done,  
>> The power and progress, fiercely won.
